**Step 1 :** Generate Plaintext **m**, **keyA** and **keyB** by clicking on rexpective buttons **PART I** of the simulation page.

**Step 2 :** Enter generated Plaintext **m** from **PART I** to **PART II** in "Your text to be encrypted/decrypted:" block.

**Step 3 :** Enter generated **keyA** from **PART I** to **PART II** "Key to be used:" block and click on DES encrpt button to output ciphertext **c1**.This is First Encryption.

**Step 4 :** Enter generated ciphertext **c1** from **PART II** "Output:" Block to **PART II** in "Your text to be encrypted/decrypted:" block.

**Step 5 :** Enter generated **keyB** from **PART I** to **PART II** in "Key to be used:" block and click on DES decrypt button to output ciphertect **c2**.This is Second Encryption.

**Step 6 :** Enter generated ciphertext c2** from **PART II** "Output:" block to **PART II** in "Your text to be encrypted/decrypted:" block.

**Step 7 :** Enter generated **keyA** from **PART I** to **PART II** "Key to be used:" block and click on DES encrpt button to output ciphertext **c3**.This is Third Encryption. As Encryption is done thrice.This Scheme is called triple DES.

**Step 7 :** Enter generated ciphertext **c3** from **PART II** "Output:" Block to PART **III** "Enter your answer here:" block inorder to verify your Triple DES.
